Keras Insightface implementation tutorial

- I'm still working on this, many things are still testing here, so there are a lot of errors atm.
- My notebook [Keras Insightface](https://github.com/leondgarse/Atom_notebook/blob/master/public/2019/11-18_keras_insightface.md#keras-insightface) is more catching up my current stat.
- **Current accuracy**

| Model backbone | lfw      | cfp_fp   | agedb_30 |
| -------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
